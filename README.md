# healpix

A Go-lang implementation of the HEALPix projection and pixelization of a sphere. This package is **early stage** and not yet recommended for integration. However, features incorporated into the master branch generally have good test coverage.

The HEALPix pixelization is 'equal-area' for each pixel: a pixel at the equator of the sphere contains the same resolution of data as a pixel at the poles (unlike many pixelizations based on more common projections). The resolution increments as a scaled, squared power of 2, and this package supports spheres divided into up to 12*((2^29)^2) pixels, i.e. 29 different levels of resolution.

HEALPix supports two basic pixel numbering schemes:

1. **Nested** - useful for efficient querying of nearest neighbors for individual pixels
2. **Ring** - useful for efficient spherical harmonic computations

A third numbering scheme, **Nested Unique**, allows for the selection of pixels at different scales of resolution, allowing for 'sparse' HEALPix queries and data set representations in addition to the default 'dense' representation.

## Roadmap

- [x] - Querying nearest neighbors
- [ ] - Support 'Nested Unique' pixel numbering (for multiresolution)
- [ ] - Support Cartesian 3-vector 'positions'
- [ ] - Querying discs
- [ ] - Querying polygons
- [ ] - Multiresolution pixel range sets
